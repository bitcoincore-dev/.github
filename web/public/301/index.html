</span></code></pre><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Blind Merged Mining (BMM) is a way of mining optional extension blocks
(ie, &quot;asymmetric sidechains&quot;). BMM produces weak guarantees that the
block is valid, for *any* arbitrary set of rules; and yet it does so
without requiring miners to actually do any validation on the block
whatsoever.</p>
<p>BMM actually is a process that spans two or more chains. Here we focus
on the modifications to mainchain Bitcoin. For an explanation of the
&quot;whole picture&quot;, please see <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/blind-merged-mining/">this
post</a>.</p>
<p>Our goal here, is to allow mainchain miners to trustlessly &quot;sell&quot; the
act of finding a sidechain block.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Regular &quot;Merged-Mining&quot; (MM) allows miners to reuse their hashing work
to secure other chains (for example, as in Namecoin). However,
traditional MM has two drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Miners must run a full node of the other chain. (This is because
[while miners can effortlessly create the block] miners will not
create a valid payment to themselves, unless the block that they MM
is a valid one. Therefore, miners must assemble a *valid* block
first, then MM it.)</li>
<li>Miners are paid on the other chain, not on the regular BTC
mainchain. For example, miners who MM Namecoin will earn NMC (and
they will need to sell the NMC for BTC, before selling the BTC in
order to pay for electricity).</li>
</ol>
<p>BMM addresses both shortcomings.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>Note: This document uses the notation side:\* and main:\* in front
of otherwise-ambiguous words (such as &quot;block&quot;, &quot;node&quot;, or &quot;chain&quot;), to
distinguish the mainchain version from its sidechain counterpart. We
also use &quot;Simon&quot; to refer to a Sidechain Full Node, and &quot;Mary&quot; to refer
to a mainchain miner.</p>
<h3 id="bmm-request">BMM Request</h3>
<p>To buy the right to find a sidechain block, users broadcast BMM
Requests.</p>
<p>Here, these can take two forms. The first does not require the Lightning
Network, but it does have new requirements for Immediate Expiration (see
below). The second inherits Immediate Expiration from the Lightning
Network itself, but requires extra preparation and a different/larger
message.</p>
<p>Both forms require that certain Critical Data will be committed to
within the coinbase of the block that the transaction is included in
(see BMM Accept). For the OnChain (non-Lightning) version, we have
created a new extended serialization transaction type (very similar to
how SegWit handles witness data (the witness stack)).</p>
<h4 id="immediate-expiration-fill-or-kill">Immediate Expiration (&quot;Fill-or-Kill&quot;)</h4>
<p>We would like to make special guarantees to the counterparties of this
transaction. Specifically, instead of Simon making a &quot;payment&quot; to Mary,
we prefer that Simon give Mary an &quot;offer&quot; (which she can either accept
or decline).</p>
<p>Crucially, we want Simon to safely make many offers to several different
Mary's, in realtime (ie, quickly and off-chain). However, we ultimately
want only one offer to be accepted, at most. In other words, we want
Simon's offers to *immediately expire*. If only one offer can become a
bona fide transaction, then Simon will feel comfortable making multiple
offers all day long. Because all of the Simons are making many offers,
the Marys collectively gain access to a large set of offers to choose
from.</p>
<h4 id="onchain-bmm-request">OnChain BMM Request</h4>
<p>OnChain BMMRs do not require the Lightning network, but they do have new
requirements for validation.</p>
<h5 id="structure">Structure</h5>
<p>The following data is required:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code><span style="color:#61676c;">    32-bytes  - h* sideHeaderHash
    ?~?-bytes - critical data extended serialization
        3-bytes - 0x00bf00 identifying bytes
        1-byte  - nSidechain
        2-bytes - prevSideBlockRef
        4-bytes - prevMainHeaderBytes
</span></code></pre>
<p>sideHeaderHash comes from side:chain (side:nodes build
side:blocks/headers). The identifying bytes are given here. nSidechain
identifies which sidechain we are BMMing. By the time Blind Merged
Mining can take place, it is known globally.</p>
<p>prevBlockRef, is a little more complicated (next section).</p>
<p>To qualify for inclusion in a block, BMM requests are subject to the
following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requests must match a corresponding &quot;BMM Accept&quot; (see last section
of BIP).</li>
<li>At most, only one Request is allowed in a main:block, per sidechain.
In other words, if 700 users broadcast BMM Requests for sidechain
#4, then the main:miner must choose one single Request to include.</li>
<li>The 4-bytes of prevMainHeaderBytes must match the last four bytes of
the previous main:blockheader. Thus, Simon's txns are only be valid
for the current block, in the block history that he knows about (and
therefore, the current sidechain history that he knows about).</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="prevblockref">prevBlockRef</h5>
<p>prevBlockRef is an integer that counts the number of &quot;skips&quot; one must
take in the side:chain in order to find the current side:block's parent
block. This value is zero unless the sidechain is reorganizing (or
skipping over invalid sidechain blocks). If a side:node wants to orphan
the most-recent N blocks, the value of the current block will be equal
to N; in the block after that it will be back to zero.</p>
<p><img src="bip-0301/bmm-dots-examples.png?raw=true" align="middle"></img></p>
<p>Above: Three blockchains, with different max length (small number),
reorganization histories, and prevBlockRef numbers (larger numbers
beneath blocks). The ordering given via each side:block's
&quot;prevSideBlockRef&quot; will be isomorphic to an ordering given by each
side:block's &quot;prevSideHeaderHash&quot; (&quot;prevSideHeaderHash is the
sidechain's equivalent of the mainchain's &quot;prevBlockHash&quot;). One can
freely convert from one to the other.</p>
<h5 id="extended-serialization">Extended Serialization</h5>
<p>To impose new requirements at the transaction level, we borrow the dummy
vin &amp; &quot;flag&quot; trick from SegWit style transactions. Unless all of the
requirements for sidechain critical data transactions are met by the
block it is included in, the transaction is invalid. With SegWit, this
extra data is the SegWit signature stack, and the extra requirements are
the signatures' locations and validity. In the sidechain BMM critical
data transactions, the extra data is the (nSidechain, h\*) pair, which
must meet the first two requirements (above) as well as the
main:blocknumber, which must meet the third requirement (above).</p>
<p><img src="bip-0301/witness-vs-critical.png?raw=true" align="middle"></img></p>
<p>Above: A chart showing normal txns, SegWit txns, and CriticalData txns.
The specific SegWit txn can be seen
<a href="http://srv1.yogh.io/#tx:id:D4A99AE93DF6EE3D4E42CE69338DFC1D06CCD9B198666E98FF0588057378D3D9">here</a>.</p>
<p>These types of transactions have slightly different mempool behavior,
and should probably be kept in a second mempool. These txns are
received, checked immediately, and if valid they are evaluated for
inclusion in a block. If they are not able to be included in the
specific requested block (if the block height requested has been
surpassed by the chain tip), they are discarded. In fact, after any
main:block is found, everything in this &quot;second mempool&quot; can be
discarded as new payments will be created immediately for the next block
height. (This includes cases where the blockchain reorganizes.) There is
no re-evaluation of the txns in this mempool ever -- they are evaluated
once and then either included or discarded. They never need to be
rescanned.</p>
<p>Interestingly, these payments will *always* be directed to main:miners
from non-main:miners. Therefore, non-mining full nodes do not need to
keep them in any mempool at all. Non-miner nodes can just wait for a
block to be found, and check the txn then. These transactions more
resemble a stock market's pit trade-offers (in contrast, regular Bitcoin
txns are more like paper checks).</p>
<h4 id="lightning-bmm-request">Lightning BMM Request</h4>
<p>Lightning BMMRs require Simons to have a LN-channel pathways open with
Marys. This may not always be practical (or even possible), especially
today.</p>
<p>LN txns cannot make use of prevSideBlockRef, as no one knows for sure
when (or if) they will be broadcast on-chain. Instead, they must use
prevSideBlockHash. But they otherwise require the same data:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code><span style="color:#61676c;">   
    4-bytes - Message header (0xD0520C6E)   
    1-byte - sidechain number
    32-bytes  - h* side:block hash  
    32-bytes  - prevSideBlockHash   
</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that, in OnChain BMMRs, Simon could reuse the same h\* all he
wanted, because only one OnChain BMMR could be included per main:block
per sidechain. However, on the LN no such rule can be enforced, as the
goal is to push everything off-chain and include *zero* txns. So, we
will never know what the Requests were, or how many had an effect on
anything.</p>
<p>Therefore, Simon will need to ensure that he <strong>gives each Mary a
different h\*</strong>. Simon can easily do this, as he controls the
side:block's contents and can simply increment a side:nonce -- this
changes the side:block, and changes its hash (ie, changes h\*).</p>
<p>With a unique h\* per Mary (or, more precisely, per channel), and at
most 1 h\* making it into a block (per sidechain), Simon can ensure
that he is charged, at most, one time.</p>
<p>That's probably confusing, so here is an example, in which: Simon starts
with 13 BTC, Mary starts with 40 BTC, the side:block's tx-fees currently
total 7.1 BTC, and Simon is keeping 0.1 BTC for himself and paying 7 BTC
to Mary.</p>
<p>We start with (I):</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code><span style="color:#61676c;">    Simon 13 in, Mary 40 in ; 53 in total
        Simon&#39;s version [signed by Mary]
            13 ; to Simon if TimeLock=over; OR to Mary if SimonSig
            40 ; to Mary
        Mary&#39;s version [signed by Simon]
            40 ; to me if TimeLock=over; OR to Simon if MarySig
            13 ; to Simon
</span></code></pre>
<p>And both parties move, from there to (II):</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code><span style="color:#61676c;">    Simon 13 in, Mary 40 in ; 53 in total
        Simon&#39;s version [signed by Mary]
            6 ; to Simon if TimeLock=over; OR to Mary if SimonSig
            40 ; to Mary
            7 ; to Mary if critical data requirements met; OR to Simon if LongTimeLock=over
        Mary&#39;s version [signed by Simon]
            40 ; to Mary if TimeLock=over; OR to Simon if MarySig
            6 ; to Simon
            7 ; to Mary if critical data requirements met; OR to Simon if LongTimeLock=over
</span></code></pre>
<p>From here, if the h\* side:block in question is BMMed, they can
proceed to (III):</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code><span style="color:#61676c;">    Simon 13 in, Mary 40 in ; 53 in total
        Simon&#39;s version [signed by Mary]
            6 ; to Simon if TimeLock=over; OR to Mary if SimonSig
            47 ; to Mary
        Mary&#39;s version [signed by Simon]
            47 ; to me if TimeLock=over; OR to Simon if MarySig
            6 ; to Simon
</span></code></pre>
<p>If Simon proceeds immediately, he removes Mary's incentive to care about
blocks being built on this side:block. If Simon's side:block is
orphaned, he loses his 7 BTC. Simon can either play it safe, and wait
for (for example) 100 side:blocks before moving on (ie, before moving on
to the third LN txn, above); or else Simon can take the risk if he feels
comfortable with it.</p>
<p>If the h\* side:block is not found, then (II) and (III) are basically
equivalent to each other. Simon and Mary could jointly reconstruct (I)
and go back there, or they could proceed to a new version of II (with a
different h\*, trying again with new side:block in the next
main:block).</p>
<p>Now that we have described Requests, we can describe how they are
accepted.</p>
<h3 id="bmm-accept">BMM Accept</h3>
<p>For each BMM Request that a main:miner &quot;accepts&quot;, main:miners must place
an OP Return output into their main:coinbase txn. (We've changed the
tx-standardness policy to allow multiple OP_RETURNs.)</p>
<p>The following data is required in the &quot;accept&quot; OP_RETURN output:</p>
<p><code>   1-byte - OP_RETURN (0x6a)</code><br />
<code>   1-byte - Push the following 36 bytes (0x24)</code><br />
<code>   4-bytes - Message header (0xD3407053)</code><br />
<code>   32-bytes - h*</code><br />
<code>   ~5-bytes - BMM identifier bytes</code></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/DriveNetTESTDRIVE/DriveNet/blob/564516653c1d876429382971a011f5f6119f7eb4/src/validation.cpp#L3377-L3470">Link to
code</a>.</p>
<p>If these OP_RETURN outputs are not present, then no BMM Requests have
been accepted. (And, if they are not accepted, then they cannot be
included in a main:block.)</p>
<h2 id="backward-compatibility">Backward compatibility</h2>
<p>As a soft fork, older software will continue to operate without
modification. As stated above, BMM asks nodes to track a set of ordered
hashes, and to allow miners to &quot;sell&quot; the act of finding a sidechain
block. Non-upgraded nodes will notice that this activity (specifically:
data in coinbases, and new txns that have OP Returns and interesting
message headers) is now taking place, but they will not understand any
of it. Much like P2SH or a new OP Code, these old users will not be
directly affected by the fork, as they will have no expectations of
receiving payments of this kind.</p>
<p>(As a matter of fact, the only people receiving money here all happen to
be miners. So there is less reason than ever to expect compatibility
problems.)</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>This BIP will be deployed by &quot;version bits&quot; BIP9 with the name &quot;blindmm&quot;
and using bit 4.</p>
