<code><span style="color:#61676c;">  BIP: 119
  Layer: Consensus (soft fork)
  Title: CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY
  Author: Jeremy Rubin &lt;j@rubin.io&gt;
  Comments-URI: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/wiki/Comments:BIP-0119
  Status: Draft
  Type: Standards Track
  Created: 2020-01-06
  License: BSD-3-Clause
</span></code></pre><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP proposes a new opcode, OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, to be activated
as a change to the semantics of OP_NOP4.</p>
<p>The new opcode has applications for transaction congestion control and
payment channel instantiation, among others, which are described in the
Motivation section of this BIP.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY uses opcode OP_NOP4 (0xb3) as a soft fork
upgrade.</p>
<p>OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is at least one element on the stack, fail otherwise</li>
<li>The element on the stack is 32 bytes long, NOP otherwise</li>
<li>The StandardTemplateHash of the transaction at the current input
index is equal to the element on the stack, fail otherwise</li>
</ul>
<p>The StandardTemplateHash commits to the serialized version, locktime,
scriptSigs hash (if any non-null scriptSigs), number of inputs,
sequences hash, number of outputs, outputs hash, and currently executing
input index.</p>
<p>The recommended standardness rules additionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reject non-32 byte as SCRIPT_ERR_DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Covenants are restrictions on how a coin may be spent beyond key
ownership. Covenants can be useful to construct smart contracts. As
covenants are complex to implement and risk of introducing fungibility
discriminants they have not been seriously considered for inclusion in
Bitcoin.</p>
<p>This BIP introduces a simple covenant called a *template* which
enables a limited set of highly valuable use cases without significant
risk.</p>
<p>A few examples are described below, which should be the subject of
future non-consensus standardization efforts.</p>
<h3 id="congestion-controlled-transactions">Congestion Controlled Transactions</h3>
<p>When there is a high demand for blockspace it becomes very expensive to
make transactions. A large volume payment processor may aggregate all
their payments into a single O(1) transaction commitment for purposes of
confirmation using CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY. Then, some time later, the
payments can be expanded out of that UTXO when the demand for blockspace
is decreased. These payments can be structured in a tree-like fashion to
reduce individual costs of redemption.</p>
<p>The below chart showcases the structure of these transactions in
comparison to normal transactions and batched transactions.</p>
<p><img src="bip-0119/states.svg" align="middle"></img></p>
<p>A simulation is shown below of what impact this could have on mempool
backlog given 5% network adoption, and 50% network adoption. The code
for the simulation is provided in this BIP's subdirectory.</p>
<p><img src="bip-0119/five.png" align="middle"></img>
<img src="bip-0119/fifty.png" align="middle"></img></p>
<h3 id="payment-channels">Payment Channels</h3>
<p>There are numerous payment channel related uses.</p>
<h4 id="channel-factories">Channel Factories</h4>
<p>Using CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY for Channel Factories is similar to the use
for Congestion Control, except the leaf node transactions are channels
instead of plain payments. The channel can be between the sender and
recipient or a target of recipient's choice. Using an
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, the recipient may give the sender an address which
makes a tree of channels unbeknownst to them. These channels are time
insensitive for setup, as all punishments are relative timelocked to the
penultimate transaction node. Thus, coins sent using a congestion
controlled transaction can still enjoy instant liquidity.</p>
<h4 id="non-interactive-channels">Non-Interactive Channels</h4>
<p>When opening a traditional payment channel, both parties to the channel
must participate. This is because the channel uses pre-signed multi-sig
transactions to ensure that a channel can always be exited by either
party, before entering. With CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, it’s possible for a
single party to construct a channel which either party can exit from
without requiring signatures from both parties. These payment channels
can operate in one direction, paying to the channel &quot;listener&quot; without
need for their private key to be online.
<img src="bip-0119/nic.svg" align="middle"></img></p>
<h4 id="increased-channel-routes">Increased Channel Routes</h4>
<p>In the Lightning Network protocol, Hashed Time Locked Contracts (HTLCS)
are used in the construction of channels. A new HTLC is required per
route that the channel is serving in. In BOLT #2, this maximum number
of HTLCs in a channel is hard limited to 483 as the maximum safe size to
prevent the transaction from being too large to be valid. In common
software implementations such as LND, this limit is set much lower to 12
HTLCS. This is because accepting a larger number of HTLCS makes it more
difficult for transactions to confirm during congested periods as they
must pay higher fees. Therefore, similarly to how congestion control is
handled for normal transaction, lightning channel updates can be done
across an CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY tree, allowing nodes to safely use many
more HTLCS. Because each HTLC can have its own relative time lock in the
tree, this also improves the latency sensitivity of the lightning
protocol on contested channel close.</p>
<h3 id="wallet-vaults">Wallet Vaults</h3>
<p>When greater security is required for cold storage solutions, there can
be default script paths that move funds from one target to another
target. For example, a cold wallet can be set up where one customer
support desk can, without further authorization, move a portion of the
funds (using multiple pre-set amounts) into a lukewarm wallet operated
by an isolated support desk. The support desk can then issue some funds
to a hot wallet, and send the remainder back to cold storage with a
similar withdrawal mechanism in place. This is all possible without
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, but CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY eliminates the need for
coordination and online signers, as well as reducing the ability for a
support desk to improperly move funds. Furthermore, all such designs can
be combined with relative time locks to give time for compliance and
risk desks to intervene.</p>
<p><img src="bip-0119/vaults.svg" align="middle"></img></p>
<h3 id="coinjoin">CoinJoin</h3>
<p>CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY makes it much easier to set up trustless CoinJoins
than previously because participants agree on a single output which pays
all participants, which will be lower fee than before. Further Each
participant doesn't need to know the totality of the outputs committed
to by that output, they only have to verify their own sub-tree will pay
them.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-specification">Detailed Specification</h2>
<p>The below code is the main logic for verifying CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, and
is the canonical specification for the semantics of
OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY.</p>
<p><code>   case OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY:</code><br />
<code>   {</code><br />

<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>Deployment should be done via BIP 9 VersionBits.</p>
<p>The start time and bit in the implementation are currently set to bit 5
and March 1st, 2020, but this is subject to change while the BIP is a
draft.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of unclarity, the parameters are:</p>
<p><code>   consensus.vDeployments[Consensus::DEPLOYMENT_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY].bit = 5;</code><br />
<code>   consensus.vDeployments[Consensus::DEPLOYMENT_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY].nStartTime = 1583020800; // March 1, 2020</code><br />
<code>   consensus.vDeployments[Consensus::DEPLOYMENT_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY].nTimeout = 1614556800; //  March 1, 2021</code></p>
<p>In order to facilitate using CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, the common case of a
PayToBasicStandardTemplate with no scriptSig data shall be made standard
to permit relaying. Future template types may be standardized later as
policy changes.</p>
<h2 id="reference-implementation">Reference Implementation</h2>
<p>A reference implementation and tests are available here:
<a href="https://github.com/JeremyRubin/bitcoin/tree/checktemplateverify">https://github.com/JeremyRubin/bitcoin/tree/checktemplateverify</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>The goal of CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY is to be minimal impact on the existing
codebase -- in the future, as we become aware of more complex but shown
to be safe use cases new template types can be added.</p>
<p>Below we'll discuss the rules one-by-one:</p>
<h4 id="the-standardtemplatehash-of-the-transaction-at-the-current-input-index-matches-the-top-of-the-stack">The StandardTemplateHash of the transaction at the current input index matches the top of the stack</h4>
<p>The set of data committed to is a superset of data which can impact the
TXID of the transaction, other than the inputs. This ensures that for a
given known input, the TXIDs can also be known ahead of time. Otherwise,
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY would not be usable for Channel Factory type
constructions as the redemption TXID could be malleated and pre-signed
transactions invalidated.</p>
<h5 id="committing-to-the-version-and-locktime">Committing to the version and locktime</h5>
<p>Were these values not committed, it would be possible to delay the
spending of an output arbitrarily as well as possible to change the
TXID.</p>
<p>Committing these values, rather than restricting them to specific
values, is more flexible as it permits users of CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY the
set the version and locktime as they please.</p>
<h5 id="committing-to-the-scriptsigs-hash">Committing to the ScriptSigs Hash</h5>
<p>The scriptsig in a segwit transaction must be exactly empty, unless it
is a P2SH segwit transaction in which case it must be only the exact
redeemscript. P2SH is incompatible (unless the P2SH hash is broken) with
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY because the template hash must commit to the
ScriptSig, which must contain the redeemscript, which is a hash cycle.</p>
<p>To prevent malleability when not using a segwit input, we also commit to
the scriptsig. This makes it possible to use a 2 input
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY with a legacy pre-signed spend, as long as the exact
scriptsig for the legacy output is committed. This is more robust than
simply disallowing any scriptSig to be set with CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY.</p>
<p>If no scriptSigs are set in the transaction, there is no purpose in
hashing the data or including it in the StandardTemplateHash, so we
elide it. It is expected to be common that no scriptSigs will be set as
segwit mandates that the scriptSig must be empty (to avoid
malleability).</p>
<p>We commit to the hash rather than the values themselves as this is
already precomputed for each transaction to optimize SIGHASH_ALL
signatures.</p>
<p>Committing to the hash additionally makes it simpler to construct
StandardTemplateHashes safely and unambiguously from script.</p>
<h5 id="committing-to-the-number-of-inputs">Committing to the number of inputs</h5>
<p>If we allow more than one input to be spent in the transaction then it
would be possible for two outputs to request payment to the same set of
outputs, resulting in half the intended payments being discarded, the
&quot;half-spend&quot; problem.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the restriction on which inputs can be co-spent is critical
for payments-channel constructs where a stable TXID is a requirement
(updates would need to be signed on all combinations of inputs).</p>
<p>However, there are legitimate use cases for allowing multiple inputs.
For example:</p>
<p>Script paths:</p>
<p><code>   Path A: &lt;+24 hours&gt; OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY &lt;Pay Alice 1 Bitcoin (1 input) nLockTime for +24 hours&gt;</code><br />
<code>   Path B: OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY &lt;Pay Bob 2 Bitcoin (2 inputs)&gt;</code></p>
<p>In this case, there are 24 hours for the output to, with the addition of
a second output, pay Bob 2 BTC. If 24 hours lapses, then Alice may
redeem her 1 BTC from the contract. Both input UTXOs may have the exact
same Path B, or only one.</p>
<p>The issue with these constructs is that there are N! orders that the
inputs can be ordered in and it's not generally possible to restrict the
ordering.</p>
<p>CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY allows for users to guarantee the exact number of
inputs being spent. In general, using CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY with more than
one input is difficult and exposes subtle issues, so multiple inputs
should not be used except in specific applications.</p>
<p>In principal, committing to the Sequences Hash (below) implicitly
commits to the number of inputs, making this field strictly redundant.
However, separately committing to this number makes it easier to
construct StandardTemplateHashes from script.</p>
<p>We treat the number of inputs as a `uint32_t` because signature
checking code expects nIn to be an `unsigned int`, even though in
principal a transaction can encode more than a `uint32_t`'s worth of
inputs.</p>
<h5 id="committing-to-the-sequences-hash">Committing to the Sequences Hash</h5>
<p>If we don't commit to the sequences, then the TXID can be malleated.
This also allows us to enforce a relative sequence lock without an
OP_CSV. It is insufficient to just pair CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY with
OP_CSV because OP_CSV enforces a minimum nSequence value, not a
literal value.</p>
<p>We commit to the hash rather than the values themselves as this is
already precomputed for each transaction to optimize SIGHASH_ALL
signatures.</p>
<p>Committing to the hash additionally makes it simpler to construct
StandardTemplateHashes safely and unambiguously from script.</p>
<h5 id="committing-to-the-number-of-outputs">Committing to the Number of Outputs</h5>
<p>In principal, committing to the Outputs Hash (below) implicitly commits
to the number of outputs, making this field strictly redundant. However,
separately committing to this number makes it easier to construct
StandardTemplateHashes from script.</p>
<p>We treat the number of outputs as a `uint32_t` because a
`COutpoint` index is a `uint32_t`, even though in principal a
transaction could encode more outputs.</p>
<h5 id="committing-to-the-outputs-hash">Committing to the outputs hash</h5>
<p>This ensures that spending the UTXO is guaranteed to create the exact
outputs requested.</p>
<p>We commit to the hash rather than the values themselves as this is
already precomputed for each transaction to optimize SIGHASH_ALL
signatures.</p>
<p>Committing to the hash additionally makes it simpler to construct
StandardTemplateHashes safely and unambiguously from script.</p>
<h5 id="committing-to-the-current-input-s-index">Committing to the current input's index</h5>
<p>Committing to the currently executing input's index is not strictly
needed for anti-malleability, however it does restrict the input
orderings eliminating a source of malleability for protocol designers.</p>
<p>However, committing to the index eliminates key-reuse vulnerability to
the half-spend problem. As CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY scripts commit to being
spent at particular index, reused instances of these scripts cannot be
spent at the same index, which implies that they cannot be spent in the
same transaction. This makes it safer to design wallet vault contracts
without half-spend vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Committing to the current index doesn't prevent one from expressing a
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY which can be spent at multiple indicies. In current
script, the CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY operation can be wrapped in an OP_IF
for each index (or Tapscript branches in the future). If OP_CAT or
OP_SHA256STREAM are added to Bitcoin, the index may simply be passed in
by the witness before hashing.</p>
<h5 id="committing-to-values-by-hash">Committing to Values by Hash</h5>
<p>Committing to values by hash makes it easier and more efficient to
construct a StandardTemplateHash from script. Fields which are not
intended to be set may be committed to by hash without incurring O(n)
overhead to re-hash.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if OP_SHA256STREAM is added in the future, it may be
possible to write a script which allows adding a single output to a list
of outputs without incurring O(n) overhead by committing to a hash
midstate in the script.</p>
<h5 id="the-ordering-of-fields">The Ordering of Fields</h5>
<p>Strictly speaking, the ordering of fields is insignificant. However,
with a carefully selected order, the efficiency of future scripts (e.g.,
those using a OP_CAT or OP_SHA256STREAM) may be improved.</p>
<p>In particular, the order is selected in order of least likely to change
to most.</p>
<ol>
<li>nVersion</li>
<li>nLockTime</li>
<li>scriptSig hash (maybe!)</li>
<li>input count</li>
<li>sequences hash</li>
<li>output count</li>
<li>outputs hash</li>
<li>input index</li>
</ol>
<p>Several fields are infrequently modified. nVersion should change
infrequently. nLockTime should generally be fixed to 0 (in the case of a
payment tree, only the *first* lock time is needed to prevent
fee-sniping the root). scriptSig hash should generally not be set at
all.</p>
<p>Since there are many possible sequences hash for a given input count,
the input count comes before the sequences hash.</p>
<p>Since there are many possible outputs hashes for a given out count, the
output count comes before the outputs hash.</p>
<p>Since we're generally using a single input to many output design, we're
more likely to modify the outputs hash than the inputs hash.</p>
<p>We usually have just a single input on a CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY script,
which would suggest that it does not make sense for input index to be
the last field. However, given the desirability of being able to express
a &quot;don't care&quot; index easily (e.g., for decentralized kickstarter-type
transactions), this value is placed last.</p>
<p>As an example, the following code checks an input index argument and
concatenates it to the template and checks the template matches the
transaction.</p>
<p><code>   OP_SIZE 4 OP_EQUALVERIF</code><br />
<code>   &lt;nVersion || nLockTime || input count || sequences hash || output count || outputs hash&gt;</code><br />
<code>   OP_SWAP OP_CAT OP_SHA256 OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY</code></p>
<h3 id="design-tradeoffs-and-risks">Design Tradeoffs and Risks</h3>
<p>Covenants have historically been controversial given their potential for
fungibility risks -- coins could be minted which have a permanent
restriction on how they may or may not be spent or required to propagate
metadata.</p>
<p>In the CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY approach, the covenants are severely
restricted to simple templates. The structure of CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY
template is such that the outputs must be known exactly at the time of
construction. Based on a destructuring argument, it is only possible to
create templates which expand in a finite number of steps. Thus
templated transactions are in theory as safe as transactions which
create all the inputs directly in this regard.</p>
<p>Furthermore, templates are restricted to be spendable as a known number
of inputs only, preventing unintentional introduction of the 'half
spend' problem.</p>
<p>Templates, as restricted as they are, bear some risks.</p>
<h4 id="permanently-unspendable-outputs">Permanently Unspendable Outputs</h4>
<p>The preimage argument passed to CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY may be unknown or
otherwise unsatisfiable. However, requiring knowledge that an address is
spendable from is incompatible with sender's ability to spend to any
address (especially, OP_RETURN). If a sender needs to know the template
can be spent from before sending, they may request a signature of an
provably non-transaction challenge string from the leafs of the
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY tree.</p>
<h4 id="forwarding-addresses">Forwarding Addresses</h4>
<p>Key-reuse with CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY may be used as a form of &quot;forwarding
address contract&quot;. A forwarding address is an address which can
automatically execute in a predefined way. For example, a exchange's hot
wallet might use an address which can automatically be moved to a cold
storage address after a relative timeout.</p>
<p>The issue is that reusing addresses in this way can lead to loss of
funds. Suppose one creates an template address which forwards 1 BTC to
cold storage. Creating an output to this address with less than 1 BTC
will be frozen permanently. Paying more than 1 BTC will lead to the
funds in excess of 1BTC to be paid as a large miner fee.
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY could commit to the exact amount of bitcoin provided
by the inputs/amount of fee paid, but as this is a user error and not a
malleability issue this is not done. Future soft-forks could introduce
opcodes which allow conditionalizing which template or script branches
may be used based on inspecting the amount of funds available in a
transaction</p>
<p>As a general best practice, it is incumbent on Bitcoin users to not
reuse any address unless you are certain that the address is acceptable
for the payment attempted. This limitation and risk is not unique to
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY. For example, atomic swap scripts are single use
once the hash is revealed. Future Taproot scripts may contain many
logical branches that would be unsafe for being spent to multiple times
(e.g., a Hash Time Lock branch should be instantiated with unique hashes
each time it is used). Keys which have signed a SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT
transaction can similarly become reuse-unsafe.</p>
<p>Because CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY commits to the input index currently being
spent, reused-keys are guaranteed to execute in separate transactions
which reduces the risk of &quot;half-spend&quot; type issues.</p>
<h4 id="nop-default-and-standardness-rules">NOP-Default and Standardness Rules</h4>
<p>If the argument length is not exactly 32, CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY treats it
as a NOP. Many OP_NOP upgrades prefer to fail in such circumstances. In
particular, for CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, making an invalid argument a NOP
permits future soft-forks to upgrade the semantics or loosed
restrictions around the value being previously pushed only.</p>
<p>The standardness rules may lead an unscrupulous script developer to
accidentally rely on the stricter standardness rules to be enforced
during consensus. Should that developer submit a transaction directly to
the network relying on standardness rejection, an standardness-invalid
but consensus-valid transaction may be caused, leading to a potential
loss of funds.</p>
<h4 id="feature-redundancy">Feature Redundancy</h4>
<p>CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY templates are substantially less risky than other
covenant systems. If implemented, other covenant systems could make the
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY's functionality redundant. However, given
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY's simple semantics and low on chain cost it's likely
that it would continue to be favored even if redundant with other
capabilities.</p>
<p>More powerful covenants like those proposed by MES16, would also bring
some benefits in terms of improving the ability to adjust for things
like fees rather than relying on child-pays-for-parent or other
mechanisms. However, these features come at substantially increased
complexity and room for unintended behavior.</p>
<p>Alternatively, SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT based covenant designs can
implement something similar to templates, via a scriptPubKey like:</p>
<p><code>   &lt;sig of desired TX with PK and fixed nonce R || SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT </code><PK with public SK><code> OP_CHECKSIG</code></p>
<p>SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT bears additional technical and
implementation risks that may preclude its viability for inclusion in
Bitcoin, but the capabilities above are similar to what
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY offers. However, CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY has benefits in
terms of verification speed, as it requires only hash computation rather
than signature operations. This can be significant when constructing
large payment trees or programmatic compilations. CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY
also has a feature-wise benefit in that it provides a robust pathway for
future template upgrades.</p>
<p>CHECKSIGFROMSTACK along with OP_CAT may also be used to emulate
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY. However such constructions are more complicated to
use than CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, and encumbers additional verification
overhead absent from CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY. These types of covenants also
bear similar potential recursion issues to OP_COV which make it
unlikely for inclusion in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Given the simplicity of this approach to implement and analyze, and the
benefits realizable by user applications, CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY's template
based approach is proposed in lieu of more complete covenants system.</p>
<h2 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h2>
<p>OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY replaces a OP_NOP4 with stricter verification
semantics. Therefore, scripts which previously were valid will cease to
be valid with this change. Stricter verification semantics for an
OP_NOP are a soft fork, so existing software will be fully functional
without upgrade except for mining and block validation. Similar soft
forks for OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY and OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (see
BIP-0065 and BIP-0112) have similarly changed OP_NOP semantics without
introducing compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Older wallet software will be able to accept spends from
OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY outputs, but will require an upgrade in order to
treat PayToBasicStandardTemplate chains with a confirmed ancestor as
being &quot;trusted&quot; (i.e., eligible for spending before the transaction is
confirmed).</p>
<p>Backports of OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY can be trivially prepared (see the
reference implementation) for older node versions that can be patched
but not upgraded to a newer major release.</p>

<h3 id="note-on-similar-alternatives">Note on Similar Alternatives</h3>
<p>An earlier version of CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, CHECKOUTPUTSHASHVERIFY, is
withdrawn in favor of CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY. CHECKOUTPUTSHASHVERIFY did
not commit to the version or lock time and was thus insecure.</p>
<p>CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY could also be implemented as an extension to
Taproot, and was proposed this way earlier. However, given that
CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY has no dependency on Taproot, it is preferable to
deploy it independently.</p>
<p>CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY has also been previously referred to as
OP_SECURETHEBAG, which is mentioned here to aid in searching and
referencing discussion on this BIP.</p>
