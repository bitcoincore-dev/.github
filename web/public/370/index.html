<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>This document proposes a second version of the Partially Signed Bitcoin
Transaction format described in BIP 174 which allows for inputs and
outputs to be added to the PSBT after creation.</p>
<h3 id="copyright">Copyright</h3>
<p>This BIP is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction Version 0 as described in BIP 174
is unable to have new inputs and outputs be added to the transaction.
The fixed global unsigned transaction cannot be changed which prevents
any additional inputs or outputs to be added. PSBT Version 2 is intended
to rectify this problem.</p>
<p>An additional benficial side effect is that all information for a given
input or output will be provided by its <input-map> or <output-map>.
With Version 0, to retrieve all of the information for an input or
output, data would need to be found in two locations: the
<input-map>/<output-map> and the global unsigned transaction. PSBT
Version 2 now moves all related information to one place.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>PSBT Version 2 (PSBTv2) only specifies new fields and field
inclusion/exclusion requirements.</p>
<p><code>PSBT_GLOBAL_UNSIGNED_TX</code> must be excluded in PSBTv2.
<code>PSBT_GLOBAL_VERSION</code> must be included in PSBTv2 and set to version
number 2[1].</p>
<p>The new global types for PSBT Version 2 are as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th><keytype></th><th><keydata></th><th><keydata> Description</th><th><valuedata></th><th><valuedata> Description</th><th>Versions Requiring Inclusion</th><th>Versions Requiring Exclusion</th><th>Versions Allowing Inclusion</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Transaction Version</td><td><code>PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_VERSION = 0x02</code></td><td>None</td><td>No key data</td><td><code>&lt;32-bit uint&gt;</code></td><td>The 32-bit little endian signed integer representing the version number of the transaction being created. Note that this is not the same as the PSBT version number specified by the PSBT_GLOBAL_VERSION field.</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fallback Locktime</td><td><code>PSBT_GLOBAL_FALLBACK_LOCKTIME = 0x03</code></td><td>None</td><td>No key data</td><td><code>&lt;32-bit uint&gt;</code></td><td>The 32-bit little endian unsigned integer representing the transaction locktime to use if no inputs specify a required locktime.</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Input Count</td><td><code>PSBT_GLOBAL_INPUT_COUNT = 0x04</code></td><td>None</td><td>No key data</td><td><compact size uint></td><td>Compact size unsigned integer representing the number of inputs in this PSBT.</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Output Count</td><td><code>PSBT_GLOBAL_OUTPUT_COUNT = 0x05</code></td><td>None</td><td>No key data</td><td><compact size uint></td><td>Compact size unsigned integer representing the number of outputs in this PSBT.</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transaction Modifiable Flags</td><td><code>PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE = 0x06</code></td><td>None</td><td>No key data</td><td><code>&lt;8-bit uint&gt;</code></td><td>An 8 bit little endian unsigned integer as a bitfield for various transaction modification flags. Bit 0 is the Inputs Modifiable Flag and indicates whether inputs can be modified. Bit 1 is the Outputs Modifiable Flag and indicates whether outputs can be modified. Bit 2 is the Has SIGHASH_SINGLE flag and indicates whether the transaction has a SIGHASH_SINGLE signature who's input and output pairing must be preserved. Bit 2 essentially indicates that the Constructor must iterate the inputs to determine whether and how to add an input.</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr>

<p>The new per-input types for PSBT Version 2 are defined as follows:</p>

<tr><td>Spent Output Index</td><td><code>PSBT_IN_OUTPUT_INDEX = 0x0f</code></td><td>None</td><td>No key data</td><td><code>&lt;32-bit uint&gt;</code></td><td>32 bit little endian integer representing the index of the output being spent in the transaction with the txid of PSBT_IN_PREVIOUS_TXID.</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sequence Number</td><td><code>PSBT_IN_SEQUENCE = 0x10</code></td><td>None</td><td>No key data</td><td><code>&lt;32-bit uint&gt;</code></td><td>The 32 bit unsigned little endian integer for the sequence number of this input.

<h3 id="determining-lock-time">Determining Lock Time</h3>
<p>The nLockTime field of a transaction is determined by inspecting the
PSBT_GLOBAL_FALLBACK_LOCKTIME and each input's
PSBT_IN_REQUIRED_TIME_LOCKTIME and
PSBT_IN_REQUIRED_HEIGHT_LOCKTIME fields. If none of the inputs have
a PSBT_IN_REQUIRED_TIME_LOCKTIME and
PSBT_IN_REQUIRED_HEIGHT_LOCKTIME, then
PSBT_GLOBAL_FALLBACK_LOCKTIME must be used. If
PSBT_GLOBAL_FALLBACK_LOCKTIME is not provided, then it is assumed to
be 0.</p>
<p>If one or more inuts have a PSBT_IN_REQUIRED_TIME_LOCKTIME or
PSBT_IN_REQUIRED_HEIGHT_LOCKTIME, then the field chosen is the one
which is supported by all of the inputs. This can be determined by
looking at all of the inputs which specify a locktime in either of those
fields, and choosing the field which is present in all of those inputs.
Inputs not specifying a lock time field can take both types of lock
times, as can those that specify both. The lock time chosen is then the
maximum value of the chosen type of lock time.</p>
<h3 id="unique-identification">Unique Identification</h3>
<p>PSBTv2s can be uniquely identified by constructing an unsigned
transaction given the information provided in the PSBT and computing the
transaction ID of that transaction. Since PSBT_IN_SEQUENCE can be
changed by Updaters and Combiners, the sequence number in this unsigned
transaction must be set to 0 (not final, nor the sequence in
PSBT_IN_SEQUENCE). The lock time in this unsigned transaction must be
computed as described previously.</p>
<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
<p>PSBTv2 introduces new roles and modifies some existing roles.</p>
<h3 id="creator">Creator</h3>
<p>In PSBTv2, the Creator initializes the PSBT with 0 inputs and 0 outputs.
The PSBT version number is set to 2. The transaction version number must
be set to at least 2. [2] The Creator should also set
PSBT_GLOBAL_FALLBACK_LOCKTIME. If the Creator is not also a
Constructor and will be giving the PSBT to others to add inputs and
outputs, the PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE field must be present and and
the Inputs Modifiable and Outputs Modifiable flags set appropriately. If
the Creator is a Constructor and no inputs and outputs will be added by
other entities, PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE may be omitted.</p>
<h3 id="constructor">Constructor</h3>
<p>This Constructor is only present for PSBTv2. Once a Creator initializes
the PSBT, a constructor will add inputs and outputs. Before any input or
output may be added, the constructor must check the
PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE field. Inputs may only be added if the
Inputs Modifiable flag is True. Outputs may only be added if the Outputs
Modifiable flag is True.</p>
<p>When an input or output is added, the corresponding
PSBT_GLOBAL_INPUT_COUNT or PSBT_GLOBAL_OUTPUT_COUNT must be
incremeted to reflect the number of inputs and outputs in the PSBT. When
an input is added, it must have PSBT_IN_PREVIOUS_TXID and
PSBT_IN_OUTPUT_INDEX set. When an output is added, it must have
PSBT_OUT_VALUE and PSBT_OUT_OUTPUT_SCRIPT set. If the input has a
required timelock, Constructors must set the requisite timelock field.
If the input has a required time based timelock, then
PSBT_IN_REQUIRED_TIME_TIMELOCK must be set If the input has a
required height based timelock, then
PSBT_IN_REQUIRED_HEIGHT_TIMELOCK must be set. If an input has both
types of timelocks, then both may be set. In some cases, an input that
can allow both types, but a particular branch supporting only one type
of timelock will be taken, then the type of timelock that will be used
can be the only one set.</p>
<p>If an input being added specifies a required time lock, then the
Constructor must iterate through all of the existing inputs and ensure
that the time lock types are compatible. Additionally, if during this
iteration, it finds that any inputs have signatures, it must ensure that
the newly added input does not change the transaction's locktime. If the
newly added input has an incompatible time lock, then it must not be
added. If it changes the transaction's locktime when there are existing
signatures, it must not be added.</p>
<p>If the Has SIGHASH_SINGLE flag is True, then the Constructor must
iterate through the inputs and find the inputs which have signatures
that use SIGHASH_SINGLE. The same number of inputs and outputs must be
added before those inputs and their corresponding outputs.</p>
<p>A Constructor may choose to declare that no further inputs and outputs
can be added to the transaction by setting the booleans in
PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE to False or by removing this field
entirely.</p>
<p>A single entity is likely to be both a Creator and Constructor.</p>
<h3 id="updater">Updater</h3>
<p>For PSBTv2, an Updater can set the sequence number.</p>
<h3 id="signer">Signer</h3>
<p>For PSBTv2s, a signer must update the PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE field
after signing inputs so that it accurately reflects the state of the
PSBT. If the Signer added a signature that does not use
SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY, the Input Modifiable flag must be set to False.
If the Signer added a signature that does not use SIGHASH_NONE, the
Outputs Modifiable flag must be set to False. If the Signer added a
signature that uses SIGHASH_SINGLE, the Has SIGHASH_SINGLE flag must
be set to True.</p>
<h3 id="transaction-extractor">Transaction Extractor</h3>
<p>For PSBTv2s, the transaction is constructed using the PSBTv2 fields. The
lock time for this transaction is determined as described in the
Determining Lock Time section. The Extractor should produce a fully
valid, network serialized transaction if all inputs are complete.</p>
<h2 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h2>
<p>PSBTv2 shares the same gemeric format as PSBTv0 as defined in BIP 174.
Parsers for PSBTv0 should be able to deserialize PSBTv2 with only
changes to support the new fields.</p>
<p>However PSBTv2 is incompatible with PSBTv0, and vice versa due to the
use of the PSBT_GLOBAL_VERSION. This incompatibility is intentional so
that PSBT_GLOBAL_UNSIGNED_TX could be removed in PSBTv2. However it
is possible to convert a PSBTv2 to a PSBTv0 by creating an unsigned
transaction from the PSBTv2 fields.</p>

<li><strong>What happened to version number 1?</strong> Version number 1 is skipped
because PSBT Version 0 has been colloquially referred to as version
<ol>
<li>Originally this BIP was to be version 1, but because it has been
colloquially referred to as version 2 during its design phrase, it
was decided to change the version number to 2 so that there would
not be any confusion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Why does the transaction version number need to be at least 2?</strong>
The transaction version number is part of the validation rules for
some features such as OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. Since it is backwards
compatible, and there are other ways to disable those features (e.g.
through sequence numbers), it is easier to require transactions be
able to support these features than to try to negotiate the
transaction version number.</li>
