<p>This BIP describes a simple way to construct proof-of-reserves
transactions. This proposal formalizes a standard format for
constructing such proofs, easing their construction with existing wallet
infrastructure and enabling general proof-verification software. It
relies on existing standards such as regular Bitcoin transaction
serialization/validation and the BIP 174 PSBT format. The proposal also
includes the description of a PSBT extension for a better user
experience.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>From the very early days in the history of Bitcoin, there have been
companies managing bitcoins for their users. These users give up control
over their coins in return for a certain service. Inevitably, there have
been many cases of companies losing their users' bitcoins without timely
disclosing such events to the public. Proofs of Reserves are a way for
companies managing large amounts of bitcoins to prove ownership over a
given amount of funds. The regular proof of control helps to ensure that
no significant loss has occurred.</p>
<p>While the term proof-of-reserves is not new by any means, the procedure
is not very common among high-value custodian companies. One of the
reasons for this is that every company that wants to perform a
proof-of-reserves has to construct its own way to do so. Accordingly,
their users have to understand the construction of the proof in order to
be able to verify it. This raises the bar of entry both for custodians
and for users.</p>
<h3 id="what-this-bip-is-not-doing">What this BIP is not doing</h3>
<p>The proof-of-reserve construction described in this document has some
known shortcomings, mostly with regards to its privacy properties. While
there exists research about improved proof-of-reserves mechanisms that
have much better privacy properties[1], this BIP intentionally only
formalizes the de-facto existing method.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>Our specification consists of two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>the format for the actual proofs</li>
<li>a file format used to package a set of proofs and relevant metadata</li>
</ol>
<p>The final construction should have the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>flexible proof construction to support complex wallet
infrastructures</li>
<li>easy integration with existing wallet solutions (both hardware and
software wallets)</li>
<li>support for verification via a standard procedure, regardless of
publisher of the proof</li>
<li>proof prevents reuse of proofs by other parties by committing to a
message</li>
<li>allow validating that the issuer had the funds under his control at
a certain block, regardless of what happened after that block</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proof-format">Proof Format</h3>
<p>To allow for maximal compatibility with existing systems, proofs are
formatted as regular Bitcoin transactions. However, one small adaptation
to the transaction is made that has two functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>make the transaction unspendable to avoid putting funds at risk</li>
<li>link the proof to the issuer of the proof to prevent copying proofs
from other custodians</li>
</ol>
<p>The resulting construction is a Bitcoin transaction with the following
characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first input (the &quot;commitment input&quot;)
<ul>
<li>MUST have the txid part of the previous outpoint set to the
SHA-256 hash of the commitment message prefixed with
&quot;Proof-of-Reserves: &quot;[2] and index 0.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The remaining inputs
<ul>
<li>MUST have signatures that commit to the commitment input (e.g.
using <code>SIGHASH_ALL</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The transaction MUST have a single output that is the exact sum of
all the inputs, assuming the commitment input to have 0 value; this
means the transaction has no miner fee.</li>
</ul>
<p>The existence of the first input (which is just a commitment hash)
ensures that this transaction is invalid and can never be confirmed.</p>
<h3 id="proof-file-format">Proof File Format</h3>
<p>In theory, the first part of the specification would be sufficient as a
minimum viable standard. However, there are a number of motivations to
extend the standard with an extra layer of metadata:</p>
<ol>
<li><h2 id="constructing-and-combining-multiple-proofs">constructing and combining multiple proofs</h2>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code>Having thousands of UTXOs spread across different offline and
online wallets could make it difficult to construct a single
proof transaction with all UTXOs. Allowing multiple proof
transactions with the same commitment message and block number
gives extra flexibility to custodians with complex wallet
infrastructure without making the combined proof less secure.
</code></pre></li>
<li><h2 id="metadata-for-verification">metadata for verification</h2>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code>Not all systems that will be used for verification have access
to a full index of all transactions. However, proofs should be
easily verifiable even after some of the UTXOs used in the proof
are no longer unspent. Metadata present in the proof allows for
relatively efficient verification of proofs even if no
transaction index is available.
</code></pre></li>
<li><h2 id="potential-future-improvements">potential future improvements</h2>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code>The extensible metadata format allows for amending the standard
in the future. One potential improvement would be having UTXO
set commitments. These would allow the proofs-of-reserves to
come with accompanying proofs-of-inclusion of all used UTXOs in
the UTXO set at the block of proof construction (making
validation even more efficient).
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>The proposed proof-file format provides a standard way of combining
multiple proofs and associated metadata. The specification of the format
is in the Protocol Buffers[3] format.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code>syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
import &quot;google/protobuf/any.proto&quot;;

message OutputMeta {
    // Identify the outpoint.
    bytes txid = 1;
    uint32 vout = 2;

    // The block hash of the block where this output was created.
    bytes block_hash = 3;
}

message FinalProof {
    // The proof transaction.  Should be able to be parsed like a regular
    // Bitcoin transaction.
    bytes proof_tx = 1;

    // The metadata of the ouputs used in the proof transaction.
    repeated OutputMeta output_metadata = 2;
}

message ProofOfReserves {
    // A version number for this format to enable extending it with
    // additional fields.
    uint32 version = 1;

    // The network magic for the network in which the proofs are valid.
    // 0xD9B4BEF9 for mainnet, 0x0709110B for testnet
    //TODO consider BIP44 coin type ids instead:
    // https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md
    uint32 network_magic = 2;

    // The commitment message for this proof-of-reserves.
    // This message is global for all the proofs.
    string message = 3;

    // The block at which this proof is supposed to be validated.
    // Verification should take into account unspentness of outputs at this
    // block height.
    bytes block_hash = 4;

    // The set of final proof transactions with their output metadata.
    repeated FinalProof final_proofs = 5;

    // Reserved field that can potentially be used by proof-construction tools.
    // It can be ignored for verification.
    repeated google.protobuf.Any pending_proofs = 6;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The last field, <code>pending_proofs</code>, leaves open some space in the same
file that can be used by proof-construction tools. This allows them to
construct different proofs incrementally without having to switch
between file formats.</p>
<h3 id="psbt-bip-174-extension">PSBT (BIP 174) extension</h3>
<p>The &quot;commitment input&quot; detailed in the proof format section does not
spend an existing UTXO and thus shouldn't be signed (empty <code>scriptSig</code>
and witness). This can cause some problems when signing this type of
transactions. For example, hardware wallets often require the signer to
provide information about all inputs of transactions they are signing,
such as the previous output or previous transaction; this data obviously
doesn't exist for the commitment inputs.</p>
<p>For most existing devices, it's possible to circumvent these
requirements by providing dummy data or by instructing the device to
ignore this specific input. However, there is still a UX problem.
Because the hardware wallet device doesn't recognize the transaction as
a proof-of-reserves transaction it will think it is signing a regular
transaction that is spending all the money in the UTXOs. Most devices
will ask for confirmation with a message along the lines of &quot;Are you
sure you want to send XXX BTC to address [...]?&quot;. This is not the best
user experience.</p>
<p>An addition to the BIP 174 PSBT format could help signing devices to
recognize proof-of-reserve transactions. The following field is added to
the BIP 174 <code>INPUT</code> map:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type: Proof-of-reserves commitment <code>PSBT_IN_POR_COMMITMENT = 0x09</code>
<ul>
<li>Key: None. The key must only contain the 1 byte type.
<ul>
<li><code>{0x09}</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Value: The UTF-8 encoded commitment message string for the
proof-of-reserves.
<ul>
<li><code>{porCommitment}</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wallets processing an input that has this field set</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST make sure the txid of the previous outpoint is set to the
SHA-256 hash of the prefixed commitment message string, as detailed
above;</li>
<li>MUST assume the input value to be 0 (without requiring the previous
output or transaction to be provided);</li>
<li>SHOULD display the commitment message to ask the user for
confirmation before signing any inputs;</li>
<li>SHOULD only provide signatures with a signature hash that commits to
this input;</li>
<li>SHOULD accept an empty <code>scriptSig</code> for this input (as if the
<code>scriptPubKey</code> was <code>OP_TRUE</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>The proof transaction specification is based on the Bitcoin transaction
serialization protocol and will thus always be compatible with
serializers that can interpret Bitcoin transactions. The protobuf file
format is custom to this BIP and has a version byte to enable updates
while attempting to remain backwards compatible.</p>
