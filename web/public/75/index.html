</span></code></pre><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP is an extension to BIP 70 that provides two enhancements to the
existing Payment Protocol.</p>
<ol>
<li>It allows the requester (Sender) of a PaymentRequest to voluntarily
sign the original request and provide a certificate to allow the
payee to know the identity of who they are transacting with.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>It encrypts the PaymentRequest that is returned, before handing it
off to the SSL/TLS layer to prevent man in the middle viewing of the
Payment Request details.</li>
</ol>
<p>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
&quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The motivation for defining this extension to the
<a href="https://bips.dev/75/bip-0070.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP70</a> Payment Protocol is to allow two
parties to exchange payment information in a permissioned and encrypted
way, such that wallet address communication can become a more automated
process. This extension also expands the types of PKI (public-key
infrastructure) data that is supported, and allows it to be shared by
both parties (with <a href="https://bips.dev/75/bip-0070.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP70</a>, only the
receiver could provide PKI information). This allows for automated
creation of off-blockchain transaction logs that are human readable, now
including information about the sender and not just the recipient.</p>
<p>The motivation for this extension to
<a href="https://bips.dev/75/bip-0070.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP70</a> is threefold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that the payment details can only be seen by the participants
in the transaction, and not by any third party.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>Enhance the Payment Protocol to allow for store and forward servers
in order to allow, for example, mobile wallets to sign and serve
Payment Requests.</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->
<ol>
<li>Allow a sender of funds the option of sharing their identity with
the receiver. This information could then be used to:</li>
</ol>
<p>#* Make Bitcoin logs (wallet transaction history) more human readable</p>
<p>#* Give the user the ability to decide whether or not they share their
Bitcoin address and other payment details when requested</p>
<p>#* Allow for an open standards based way for businesses to keep
verifiable records of their financial transactions, to better meet the
needs of accounting practices or other reporting and statutory
requirements</p>
<p>#* Automate the active exchange of payment addresses, so static
addresses and BIP32 X-Pubs can be avoided to maintain privacy and
convenience</p>
<p>In short we wanted to make Bitcoin more human, while at the same time
improving transaction privacy.</p>
<h2 id="example-use-cases">Example Use Cases</h2>
<p>1. Address Book</p>
<p>A Bitcoin wallet developer would like to offer the ability to store an
&quot;address book&quot; of payees, so users could send multiple payments to known
entities without having to request an address every time. Static
addresses compromise privacy, and address reuse is considered a security
risk. BIP32 X-Pubs allow the generation of unique addresses, but
watching an X-Pub chain for each person you wish to receive funds from
is too resource-intensive for mobile applications, and there is always a
risk of unknowingly sending funds to an X-Pub address after the owner
has lost access to the corresponding private key.</p>
<p>With this BIP, Bitcoin wallets could maintain an &quot;address book&quot; that
only needs to store each payee's public key. Adding an entry to one's
address book could be done by using a Wallet Name, scanning a QR code,
sending a URI through a text message or e-mail, or searching a public
repository. When the user wishes to make a payment, their wallet would
do all the work in the background to communicate with the payee's wallet
to receive a unique payment address. If the payee's wallet has been
lost, replaced, or destroyed, no communication will be possible, and the
sending of funds to a &quot;dead&quot; address is prevented.</p>
<p>2. Individual Permissioned Address Release</p>
<p>A Bitcoin wallet developer would like to allow users to view a potential
sending party's identifying information before deciding whether or not
to share payment information with them. Currently,
<a href="https://bips.dev/75/bip-0070.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP70</a> shares the receiver’s payment
address and identity information with anyone who requests it.</p>
<p>With this BIP, Bitcoin wallets could use the sender’s identifying
information to make a determination of whether or not to share their own
information. This gives the receiving party more control over who
receives their payment and identity information. Additionally, this
could be used to automatically provide new payment addresses to
whitelisted senders, or to protect users’ privacy from unsolicited
payment requests.</p>
<p>3. Using Store &amp; Forward Servers</p>
<p>A Bitcoin wallet developer would like to use a public Store &amp; Forward
service for an asynchronous address exchange. This is a common case for
mobile and offline wallets.</p>
<p>With this BIP, returned payment information is encrypted with an
ECDH-computed shared key before sending to a Store &amp; Forward service. In
this case, a successful attack against a Store &amp; Forward service would
not be able to read or modify wallet address or payment information,
only delete encrypted messages.</p>
<h2 id="modifying-bip70-pki-type">Modifying BIP70 pki_type</h2>
<p>This BIP adds additional possible values for the pki_type variable in
the PaymentRequest message. The complete list is now as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>pki_type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>x509+sha256</td><td>A x.509 certificate, as described in BIP70</td></tr>
<tr><td>pgp+sha256</td><td>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#OpenPGP" title="wikilink">OpenPGP</a> certificate</td></tr>
<tr><td>ecdsa+sha256</td><td>A <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1" title="wikilink">secp256k1</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm" title="wikilink">ECDSA</a> public key</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Although SHA1 was supported in BIP70, it has been deprecated
and BIP75 only supports SHA256. The hashing algorithm is still specified
in the values listed above for forward and backwards compatibility.</p>
<h2 id="new-messages">New Messages</h2>
<p>Updated [/bip-0075/paymentrequest.proto paymentrequest.proto] contains
the existing PaymentRequest Protocol Buffer messages as well as the
messages newly defined in this BIP.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Public keys from both parties must be known to each other in
order to facilitate encrypted communication. Although including both
public keys in every message may get redundant, it provides the most
flexibility as each message is completely self-contained.</p>
<h3 id="invoicerequest">InvoiceRequest</h3>
<p>The <strong>InvoiceRequest</strong> message allows a Sender to send information to
the Receiver such that the Receiver can create and return a
PaymentRequest.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code>message InvoiceRequest {
        required bytes  sender_public_key = 1;

<h3 id="protocolmessagetype-enum">ProtocolMessageType Enum</h3>
<p>This enum is used in the newly defined
<a href="https://bips.dev/75/#ProtocolMessage" title="wikilink">ProtocolMessage</a> and
<a href="https://bips.dev/75/#EncryptedProtocolMessage" title="wikilink">EncryptedProtocolMessage</a>
messages to define the serialized message type. The
<strong>ProtocolMessageType</strong> enum is defined in an extensible way to allow
for new message type additions to the Payment Protocol.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">
<code>enum ProtocolMessageType {
    UNKNOWN_MESSAGE_TYPE = 0;
    INVOICE_REQUEST = 1;
    PAYMENT_REQUEST = 2;
    PAYMENT = 3;
    PAYMENT_ACK = 4;
}
</code></pre><h3 id="protocolmessage">ProtocolMessage</h3>
<p>The <strong>ProtocolMessage</strong> message is an encapsulating wrapper for any
Payment Protocol message. It allows two-way, non-encrypted communication
of Payment Protocol messages. The message also includes a status code
and a status message that is used for error communication such that the
protocol does not rely on transport-layer error handling.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">

</tbody></table>
<h3 id="versioning">Versioning</h3>
<p>This BIP introduces version 1 of this protocol. All messages sent using
these base requirements MUST use a value of 1 for the version number.
Any future BIPs that modify this protocol (encryption schemes, etc) MUST
each increment the version number by 1.</p>
<p>When initiating communication, the version field of the first message
SHOULD be set to the highest version number the sender understands. All
clients MUST be able to understand all version numbers less than the
highest number they support. If a client receives a message with a
version number higher than they understand, they MUST send the message
back to the sender with a status code of 101 (&quot;version too high&quot;) and
the version field set to the highest version number the recipient
understands. The sender must then resend the original message using the
same version number returned by the recipient or abort.</p>
<h3 id="encryptedprotocolmessage">EncryptedProtocolMessage</h3>
<p>The <strong>EncryptedProtocolMessage</strong> message is an encapsualting wrapper for
any Payment Protocol message. It allows two-way, authenticated and
encrypted communication of Payment Protocol messages in order to keep
their contents secret. The message also includes a status code and
status message that is used for error communication such that the
protocol does not rely on transport-layer error handling.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;">

<h2 id="payment-protocol-process-with-invoicerequests">Payment Protocol Process with InvoiceRequests</h2>
<p>The full process overview for using <strong>InvoiceRequests</strong> in the Payment
Protocol is defined below.</p>
<p>All Payment Protocol messages MUST be encapsulated in either a
<a href="https://bips.dev/75/#ProtocolMessage" title="wikilink">ProtocolMessage</a> or
<a href="https://bips.dev/75/#EncryptedProcotolMessage" title="wikilink">EncryptedProtocolMessage</a>. Once
the process begins using
<a href="https://bips.dev/75/#EncryptedProtocolMessage" title="wikilink">EncryptedProtocolMessage</a>
messages, all subsequent communications MUST use
<a href="https://bips.dev/75/#EncryptedProtocolMessage" title="wikilink">EncryptedProtocolMessages</a>.</p>
<p>All Payment Protocol messages SHOULD be communicated using
<a href="https://bips.dev/75/#EncryptedProtocolMessage" title="wikilink">EncryptedProtocolMessage</a>
encapsulating messages with the exception that an
<a href="https://bips.dev/75/#InvoiceRequest" title="wikilink">InvoiceRequest</a> MAY be communicated using
the <a href="https://bips.dev/75/#ProtocolMessage" title="wikilink">ProtocolMessage</a> if the receiver's
public key is unknown.</p>
<p>The process of creating encrypted Payment Protocol messages is
enumerated in <a href="https://bips.dev/75/#Sending_Encrypted_Payment_Protocol_Messages_using_EncryptedProtocolMessages" title="wikilink">Sending Encrypted Payment Protocol Messages using
EncryptedProtocolMessages</a>,
and the process of decrypting encrypted messages can be found under
<a href="https://bips.dev/75/#Validating_and_Decrypting_Payment_Protocol_Messages_using_EncryptedProtocolMessages" title="wikilink">Validating and Decrypting Payment Protocol Messages using
EncryptedProtocolMessages</a>.</p>
<p>A standard exchange from start to finish would look like the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sender creates InvoiceRequest</li>
<li>Sender encapsulates InvoiceRequest in (Encrypted)ProtocolMessage</li>
<li>Sender sends (Encrypted)ProtocolMessage to Receiver</li>
<li>Receiver retrieves InvoiceRequest in (Encrypted)ProtocolMessage from
Sender</li>
<li>Receiver creates PaymentRequest</li>
<li>Receiver encapsulates PaymentRequest in EncryptedProtocolMessage</li>
<li>Receiver transmits EncryptedProtocolMessage to Sender</li>
<li>Sender validates PaymentRequest retrieved from the
EncryptedProtocolMessage</li>
<li>The PaymentRequest is processed according to
<a href="https://bips.dev/75/bip-0070.mediawiki" title="wikilink">BIP70</a>, including optional Payment
and PaymentACK messages encapsulated in EncryptedProtocolMessage
messages.</li>

include a status code which conveys information about the last message
received, if any (for the first message sent, use a status of 1 &quot;OK&quot;
even though there was no previous message). In the case of an error that
causes the Payment Protocol process to be stopped or requires that
message be retried, a ProtocolMessage or EncryptedProtocolMessage SHOULD
be returned by the party generating the error. The content of the
message MUST contain the same <strong>serialized_message</strong> or

<p>+==Canceling A Message==+ If a participant to a transaction would like
to inform the other party that a previous message should be canceled,
they can send the same message with a status code of 2 (&quot;Cancel&quot;) and,
where applicable, an updated nonce. How recipients make use of the
&quot;Cancel&quot; message is up to developers. For example, wallet developers may
want to offer users the ability to cancel payment requests they have
sent to other users, and have that change reflected in the recipient's
UI. Developers using the non-encrypted ProtocolMessage may want to
ignore &quot;Cancel&quot; messages, as it may be difficult to authenticate that
the message originated from the same user.</p>
<h3 id="transport-layer-communication-errors">Transport Layer Communication Errors</h3>
<p>Communication errors MUST be communicated to the party that initiated
the communication via the communication layer's existing error messaging

<p>For the following we assume the Sender already knows the Receiver's
public key, and the exchange is being facilitated by a Store &amp; Forward
server which requires valid signatures for authentication.</p>
<p><strong>nonce</strong> MUST be set to a non-repeating number <strong>and</strong> MUST be chosen
by the encryptor. The current epoch time in microseconds SHOULD be used,
unless the creating device doesn't have access to a RTC (in the case of
a smart card, for example). The service receiving the message containing
the <strong>nonce</strong> MAY use whatever method to make sure that the <strong>nonce</strong> is
never repeated.</p>

Receiver's EC keypair</li>
<li><strong>nonce</strong> MUST be set to the nonce used in the AES-256-GCM
encryption operation</li>
<li>Set <strong>identifier</strong> to the identifier value received in the
originating InvoiceRequest's ProtocolMessage or
EncryptedProtocolMessage wrapper message</li>
<li>Set <strong>signature</strong> to &quot;&quot;</li>
<li>Sign the serialized

message with the communicating party's EC public key</li>
<li>Set <strong>signature</strong> to the result of the signature operation above</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SIGNATURE NOTE:</strong>
<a href="https://bips.dev/75/#EncryptedProtocolMessage" title="wikilink">EncryptedProtocolMessage</a>
messages are signed with the public keys of the party transmitting the
message. This allows a Store &amp; Forward server or other transmission
system to prevent spam or other abuses. For those who are privacy
conscious and don't want the server to track the interactions between
two public keys, the Sender can generate a new public key for each
interaction to keep their identity anonymous.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>nonce</strong> MUST not be repeated. The service receiving the

use whatever method to make sure that the nonce is never repeated.</li>
<li>Decrypt the serialized Payment Protocol message using AES-256-GCM

<h3 id="ecdh-point-generation-and-aes-256-gcm-mode-setup">ECDH Point Generation and AES-256 (GCM Mode) Setup</h3>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: AES-256-GCM is used because it provides authenticated
encryption facilities, thus negating the need for a separate message
hash for authentication.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate the <strong>secret point</strong> using

<h4 id="aes-256-gcm-authentication-tag-use">AES-256 GCM Authentication Tag Use</h4>
<p>The 16 byte authentication tag resulting from the AES-GCM encrypt
operation MUST be prefixed to the returned ciphertext. The decrypt
operation will use the first 16 bytes of the ciphertext as the GCM
authentication tag and the remainder of the ciphertext as the ciphertext
in the decrypt operation.</p>
<h4 id="aes-256-gcm-additional-authenticated-data">AES-256 GCM Additional Authenticated Data</h4>
<p>When either <strong>status_code</strong> OR <strong>status_message</strong> are present, the
AES-256 GCM authenticated data used in both the encrypt and decrypt
operations MUST be: STRING(status_code) || status_message. Otherwise,
there is no additional authenticated data. This provides that, while not
encrypted, the status_code and status_message are authenticated.</p>

<p>Initial public key retrieval for

<a href="https://bips.dev/75/#EncryptedProtocolMessage" title="wikilink">EncryptedProtocolMessage</a>
encapsulation can be done in a number of ways including, but not limited
to, the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wallet Name public key asset type resolution - DNSSEC-validated name
resolution returns Base64 encoded DER-formatted EC public key via
TXT Record <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5480.txt">RFC 5480</a></li>
<li>Key Server lookup - Key Server lookup (similar to PGP's pgp.mit.edu)
based on key server identifier (i.e., e-mail address) returns Base64
encoded DER-formatted EC public key
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5480.txt">RFC 5480</a></li>
<li>QR Code - Use of QR-code to encode SEC-formatted EC public key

<li>Address Service Public Key Exposure</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="payment-paymentack-messages-with-a-http-store-forward-server">Payment / PaymentACK Messages with a HTTP Store &amp; Forward Server</h2>
<p>If a Store &amp; Forward server wishes to protect themselves from spam or
abuse, they MAY enact whatever rules they deem fit, such as the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once an InvoiceRequest or PaymentRequest is received, all subsequent
messages using the same identifier must use the same Sender and
Receiver public keys.</li>
<li>For each unique identifier, only one message each of type
InvoiceRequest, PaymentRequest, and PaymentACK may be submitted.
Payment messages may be submitted/overwritten multiple times. All
messages submitted after a PaymentACK is received will be rejected.</li>
<li>Specific messages are only saved until they have been verifiably
received by the intended recipient or a certain amount of time has
passed, whichever comes first.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clients SHOULD keep in mind Receivers can broadcast a transaction
without returning an ACK. If a Payment message needs to be updated, it
SHOULD include at least one input referenced in the original transaction
to prevent the Receiver from broadcasting both transactions and getting
paid twice.</p>

InvoiceRequest, a Store &amp; Forward server, PaymentRequest, Payment and
PaymentACK. In this case, the PaymentRequest, Payment and PaymentACK
messages are encrypted using
<a href="https://bips.dev/75/#EncryptedProtocolMessage" title="wikilink">EncryptedProtocolMessage</a> <strong>and</strong>
the Receiver submits the transaction to the Bitcoin network.</p>
